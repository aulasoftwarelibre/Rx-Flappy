# Licensing Rx-Flappy!
## Why this repo?
This repo is for licensing under a Free Software License the project shared by @NyaGarcia in the [salmorejo.tech, 2021 edition](https://salmorejo.tech/2021) event, called @NyaGarc√≠a/Rx-Flappy.

## How are we going to do that?
There is a central issue, #1, with a checklist of the different tasks to accomplish.

We'll open and close different issues for every task, questions, discussions, problems, etc.

### branches
The *master* branch is for the project explanations.

The *work-done* branch will be the real already licensed project, ready to register it to the [GNU Savannah portal](https://savannah.nongnu.org/), and give it back to @NyaGarcia.
